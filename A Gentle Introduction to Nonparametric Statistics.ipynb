    "Samples of data where we already know or can easily identify the distribution of are called parametric data. Often, parametric is used to refer to data that was drawn from a Gaussian distribution in common usage. Data in which the distribution is unknown or cannot be easily identified is called nonparametric.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case where you are working with nonparametric data, specialized nonparametric statistical methods can be used that discard all information about the distribution. As such, these methods are often referred to as distribution-free methods.\n",

    "# Parametric Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Parametric data is a sample of data drawn from a known data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we already know the distribution or we have identified the distribution, and that we know the parameters of the distribution. Often, parametric is shorthand for real-valued data drawn from a Gaussian distribution. This is a useful shorthand, but strictly this is not entirely accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have parametric data, we can use parametric methods. Continuing with the shorthand of parametric meaning Gaussian. If we have parametric data, we can harness the entire suite of statistical methods developed for data assuming a Gaussian distribution, such as:\n",
    "- Summary statistics.\n",
    "- Correlation between variables.\n",
    "- Significance tests for comparing means.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Nonparametric Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Data that does not fit a known or well-understood distribution is referred to as nonparametric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data could be non-parametric for many reasons, such as:\n",
    "- Data is not real-valued, but instead is ordinal, intervals, or some other form.\n",
    "- Data is real-valued but does not fit a well understood shape.\n",
    "- Data is almost parametric but contains outliers, multiple peaks, a shift, or some other feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a suite of methods that we can use for nonparametric data called nonparametric statistical methods. In fact, most parametric methods have an equivalent nonparametric version.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the findings from nonparametric methods are less powerful than their parametric counterparts, namely because they must be generalized to work for all types of data. We can still use them for inference and male claims about findings and results, but they will not hold the same weight as similar claims with parametric methods. Information about the distribution is discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case or ordinal or interval data, nonparametric statistics are the only type of statistics that can be used. For real-valued data, nonparametric statistical methods are required in applied machine learning when you are trying to make claims on data that does not fit the familiar Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "# Ranking Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a nonparametric statistical method can be applied, the data must be converted into a rank format.\n",
    "\n",
    "As such, statistical methods that expect data in rank format are sometimes called rank statistics, such as ranl correlation and ranl statistical hypothesis tests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ranking data is exactly as its name suggests. The procedure is as follows:\n",
    "- Sort all data is exactly in the sample in ascending order.\n",
    "- Assign as integer rank from 1 to N for each unique value in the data sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine we have the following data sample, presented as a column:"
