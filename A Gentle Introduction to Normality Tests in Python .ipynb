    "## Interpretation of a Test \n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can apply the statistical tests, you must know how to interpret the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test will return at least two things:\n",
    "- **Statistic**: A queantity calculated by the test that can be interpreted in the context of the test vua comparing it to critical values from the distribution of the test statistic.\n",
    "- **p-value**: Used to interpret the test in this case whether the sample was drawn from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each test calculates a test-specific statistic. This statistic can aid in the interpretation od the result, although ut may require a deeper profiviency with statistics and a deeper knowledge of the specific statistical test. Instead, the p-value can be used to quickly and accurately interpret the statistic in practical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tests assume that that the sample was drawn form a Gaussian distribution, Technically this is called the null hypothesis, or H0. A threshold level is chosen called alpha, pypically (or 0.05), that is used to interpret the p-value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the SciPy implementation of these tests, you can interpret the p value as follows.\n",
    "- **p<=alpha**:reject H0, not normal.\n",
    "- **p>alpha**: fail to reject H0, normal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that, in general, we are seeking results with a larger p-value to confirm that our sample was likely frawn from a Gaussian distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "A result above 5% does not mean that null pypothesis is true. It means that it is very likely true given available evidence. The p-value is not the probability of the data fitting a Gaussian distribution; it can be thought of as a value that helps us interpret the statistical test.\n",
