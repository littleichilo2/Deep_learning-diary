#What is Categorical Data?
Categorical data are variables that contain label values rather than numeric values.
The number of possible values is ofter limited to a fixed set.
Categorical variables are ofter called nominal.
some examples include:
*A pet variable with the values: 'dog' and 'cat'.
*A color variable with the values: 'red', 'green' and 'blue'
*A place variable with the values: 'first', 'second' and 'third'.
Each value represents a different category.

Some categories may have a natural relationship to each other, such as a natural ordering.
The 'place' variable above does have a natural ordering of values. This type of categorical variable is called an ordinal variable.
