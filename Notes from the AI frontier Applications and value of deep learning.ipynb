    "**Artifical intellience(AI)** stands out as a transformational technology of our digital age-and its practical application throughtout the economy is growing space. For this briefing, Note from the AI fontier: Insights from hundreds of use cases, we mapped both traditional analytics and newer \"deep learning\" techniques and the problems they can solve to more than 400 specific use cases in companies and organizations. Drawing on McKinsey Global Institute research and the applied experience with AI of McKinsey Analytics, we assess both the practical applications and the economic potential of advanced AI techniques across industries and bussiness functions. Our findings highlight the substantial potential of applying deep learning techniques to use cases across the economy, but we also see some continuing limitations and obstacles-along woth future opportunitiesw as the technologies continue their advance. Ultimately, the value of AI is not to be found in the models themseleves, but in companies' abilities to harness them.\n",

    "# Mapping AI techniques to problem types\n",
    "\n",
    "As artuficial intelligence technologies advance, so does the definition of which techniques constitute AI. For the purposes of this briefing, we use AI as shorthand for deep learning techniques that use artificial neural networks. We also examined other machine learning techniques and traditional analytics techniques(Exhibit 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/Global%20Themes/Artificial%20Intelligence/Notes%20from%20the%20AI%20frontier%20Applications%20and%20value%20of%20deep%20learning/SVGZ-AI-Impact-Ex1.ashx\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks are subset of machine learning techniques. Essentially, they are AI systems based on simulating connected \"neural units,\" loosely modeling the way that neurons interact in the brain. Computational models inspired by neural connections have been studied since the 1940s and have returned to prominence as computer processing power has increased and large training data sets have been used to successfully analyze input data such as images, video, and speech. AI practitioners refer to these techniques as \"deep learning,\" sincec neural networks have many (\"deep\") layers of simulated interconnected neurons.\n",
    "\n",
    "We analyzed the applications and value of three neural network techniques:\n",
    "- *Feed forward neural networks*: the simplest type of artificial neural network. In this architecture, information moves in only one direction, forward, from the input layer, through the \"hidden\" layers, to the output layer. There are no loops in the network. The first single-neuron network was proposed already in 1958 by AI pioneer Frank Rosenblatt. While the idea is not new, advances in computing power, training algorithms, and available data led to higher levels of performance than previously possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Recureent neural networks(RNNs)*: Artificial neural networks whose connections between neurons include loops, well-suited for processing sequences of inputs. In November 2016, Oxford University researchers reported that a system based on recurrent neural networks (and convolutional neural networks) had achieved 95 percent accuracy in reading lips, outperforming experienced human lip readers, who tested at 52 percent accuracy. \n",
    "\n",
    "- *Convolutional neural neworks(CNN)*: artificial neural networks in which the connections between neural layers are inspired by the organization of the animal visual cortex, the portion of the brain that processes images well suited for perceptual tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our use cases, we also considered two other techniques-generative adversarial networks(GANs) and reinforcement learning-but did not include them in our potential value assessment of AI, since they remain nascent techniques that are not yet widely applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Generative adversarial networks(GANs)** use two neural networks contesting one other in a zero-sum game framework(thus \"adversarial\"). GANs can learn to mimic various distributions of data (for example text, speech, and images) and are therefore valuable in generating test datasets when these are not readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reinforcement learning** is s subfield of machine learning in which systems are trained by receiving virtual \"rewards\" or \"punishments\", essentially learning by trial and error. Google DeepMind has used reinforcement learning to develop systems that can play games, including video games and board games such as Go, better than human champions.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a business setting, these analttic techniques can be applied to solve read-life problems. The most prevalent problem types are classification, continuous estimation and clustering. A list of problem types and their definitions is available in the sidebar.\n",

    "# Insights from use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "Wecollated and analyzed more than 400 use cases across 19 industries and nine business functions. They provided insight into the areas with in specific sectors where deep neural networks can potentially create the most value, the incremental lift that these neural networks can generate compared with traditional analytics (Exhibit 2), and the voracious data requirements - in terms of volume, variety, and velocity-that must be met for this potential to realized. Our library of use cases, while extensive, is not exhaustive, and may overstate or understate the potential for centain sectors. We will continue refining and adding to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of where AI can be used to improve the performance of existing use cases include:\n",
    "- *Predictive maintenance: the power if machine learning to detect anomalies*Deep learning's capacity to analyze very large amounts of high dimensional data can take existing preventive maintenance systems to a new level. Layering in additional data, such as audio and image data, fro, other sensors - including relatively cheap ones such as microphones and cameras - neural networks can enhance and possibly replace more traditional methods. AI's ability to predict failures and allow planned interventions can be used to reduce downtime and operating costs while improving production uield. For example, AI can extend the life of a cargo plane beyond what is possible using traditional analytic techniques by combining plane model data, maintenance history, IoT sensor data such as anomaly detection on engine vibration data, and images and video of engine condition.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- *AI-driven logistics optimization can reduce costs through real-time forecasts and behavioral coaching.* Application of AI techniques such as continuous estimation to logistics can add substantial value across sectors. AI can reducing delivery times. One European trucking that monitor both vehicle performance and driver behavior; drivers receive real-time coaching, including when to speed up or slow down, optimizing fuel consumption and reducing maintenance costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *AI can be a valuable tool for custimer serice management and personalization challenges.* Improved speech rocognition in call center management and call routing as a result of the application of AI techniques allow a more seamless experience for customers - and more efficient processing. The capabilities go beyond words alone. For example, deep learning analysisi of audio allows systems to assess a customers' emotional tone; in the event a customer is responding badly to the system, the call can be rerouted automatically to human operators and managers. In other areas of marketing and sales, AI techniques can also have significant impact. Combining customer demographic and past transaction data with social media monitoring can help generate individualized product recommendations. \"Next product to buy\" recommendations that target individual customers - as companies such as Amazon and Netflix have asccessfully been doing --can lead to a twofold increase in the rate of sales conversions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Two-thirds of the opportunities to use AI are in improving the performance of existing analytics use cases \n",
    "In 69 percent of the use cases we studied, deep neural networks can be used to improve performance beyond that provided by other analytic techniques. Cases in which only neural networks can be used, which we refer to here as \"greenfield\" cases, constituted just 16 percent of the total. For the remaining 15 percent, artificial neural networks provided limited additional performance over other analytics techniques, among other reasons because of data limitations that made these cases unsuitable for deep learning (Exhibit 3).\n",
    "\n",
    "Greenfield AI solutions are prevalent in business areas such as customer service management, as well as among some industries where the data are rich and voluminous and at times integrate human reactions. Among industries, we found many greenfield use cases in healthcare, in particular. Some of these cases involve disease disgnosis and improved care, and rely on rich data sets in corporation image and video inputs, including from MRIs.\n",

    "# Visual the potential impact of AI and advanced analytics\n",
    " \n",
    "Our interacitve data visualization shows the potential value created by artificial intelligence and advanced analytics technuques for 19 industries and nine business functions.\n",
    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "In many of our use cases, however, tradtional analytics and machine learning techniques continue to underpin a large percentage of the value creation potential in industries including insurance, pharmaceuticals and medical products, and telecommunications, with the potential of AI limited in certain contexts. In part this is due to the way data are used by these industries and to regulatory issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data requirements for deep learning are substantially greater than for other analytics\n",
    "\n",
    "Making effective use of neural networks in most applications requires large labeled training data sets alongside access to sufficient computing infrastructure. Furthermore, these deep learning techniques are particularly powerful in extracting patterns from complex, multidimensional data types such as images, video, and audio or speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep-learning methods require thousands of data records for models to become relatively good at classification tasks and, some cases, millons for them to perform at the level of humans. By one estimate, a supervised deep-learning algorithm will generally achieve acceptable performance when trained with a data set containing at least 10 million labeled examples. In some cases where advanced analytics is currently used, so much data are available - millon or even billions of rows per data set - that AI usage is the most appropriate technique. However, if a threshold of data volume is not reached, AI may not add value to traditional analytics techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "These massive data sets can be difficult to obtain or create for many business use cases, and labeling remains a challenge. Most cirrent AI models are trained through \"supervised learning\", which requires humans to label and categorize the underlying data. However promising new techniques are emerging to overcome these data bottlemecks, such as reinforcement learning, generative adversarial networks, transfering learning, and \"one-shot learning,\" which allows a trained AI model to learn about a subject based on a small number of real-world demonstrations or examples - and sometimes just one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizations will have to adopt and implement strategies that enable them to collect and intefrate data at scale. Even with large datasets, they will have to guard against \"overfitting,\" where a model too tightly matches the \"noisy\" or random features of the training set, resulting in a corresponding lack of accuracy in future performance, and against \"underfitting,\" where the model fails to capture all of the relevant features. Linking data across customer segments and channels, rather than allowing the data to languish in silos, is especially important to create value.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes form the AI frontier: Insights from hundreds of use cases\n",
    "\n",
    "## Realizing AI's full potential requires a diverse range of data types including images, video, and audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "Neural AI techniques excel at analyzing image, video, and audio data types because of their complex, multidimensional nature, known by practitioners as \"high dimensionality.\" Neural networks are good at dealing with high dimensionality, as multiple layers in a network can learn to represent the many different features present in the data. Thus, for facial regonition, the first layer in the network could focus on raw pixels, the next on edges and lines, another on generic facial features, and the final layer might identify the face. Unlike previous generations of AI, which often required human expertise to do \"feature engineering,\" these neural network techniques are often able to learn to represent these features in their simulated neural networks as part of the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Along with issues around the volume and variety of data, velocity is also a requirement: AI techniques require models to be retrained to match potential changing conditions, so the training data must be refreshed frequently. In one-third of the cases, the model needs to be refreshed at least monthly, and almost one in four cases requires a daily refreshl; this is especially the case in marketing and sales and in supply chain management and manufacturing. \n",
    "\n",
    "***\n",
    "# Sizing the potential value of AI\n",
    "\n",
    "We estimate that the AI techniques we cite in this briefing together have the potential to create between $3.5 trillion in value annually across nine bussiness functions in 19 industries. This constitutes about 40 percent of the overall $9.5 trillion annual impact that could potentially be enabled by all analytical techniques (Exhibit 4).\n",
    "\n",
    "Per industry, we estimate that AI's potential value amounts to between one and nine percent of 2016 revenue. The value as measured by percentage of industry revenue varies significantly among industries, depending on the specific applicable use cases, the availability of abundant and complex data, as well as on regulatory and other constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "These figures are not forecasts for a particular period, but they are indicative of the considerable potential for the global economy that advanced analytics represents.\n",
    "\n",
    "From the use cases we have examined, we find that the greatest potential value impact from using AI are both in top-line-oriented function, such as in marketing and sales, and bottom-line-oriented operational functions, including supply chain management and manufacturing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consumer industries such as retail and high tech will tend to see more potential from marketing and sales AI applications because frequent and digital interactions between business and customers generate larger data sets for AI techniques to tap into. E-commerce platforms, in particular, stand to benefit. This is because of the ease with which these platforms collect customer information such as click data or time spent on a web page and can then customize promotions, prices, and products for each customer dynamically and in real time.\n",
    "\n",
